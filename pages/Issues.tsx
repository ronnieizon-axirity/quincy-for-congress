                <div className="content-body-text text-black leading-relaxed border-b-4 border-brand-yellow pb-8 md:pb-12 space-y-6">
                  <p>As the founder and CEO of Royal Home Care and Royal Assisted Living, Quincy Bareebe has spent years delivering hands-on care to seniors and people with disabilities in our community, employing more than 70 frontline health professionals across Maryland. From helping seniors live with dignity in assisted living to supporting families caring for chronically ill loved ones at home, she has seen up close how insurance rules, drug prices, and gaps in Medicare can make the difference between stability and crisis for working families. That real-world experience—not think-tank theory—drives her commitment to guarantee quality, affordable health care as a basic right, not a privilege tied to zip code or income.</p>
                  <p>In Congress, Quincy will fight to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, close loopholes that let insurance companies deny or delay needed care, and cap out-of-pocket costs so no one has to choose between a prescription and the rent. She will work to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing, which are essential for seniors to stay healthy and independent, and push to give Medicare more power to negotiate lower drug prices across the board. Quincy will also support increased funding for home- and community-based services, so seniors and people with chronic conditions can receive care at home or in assisted living settings like the ones she operates, instead of being forced into more expensive institutional care.</p>
                  <p>Because she has managed both federal budgets and a health care workforce, Quincy knows how to pay for these improvements responsibly—by cracking down on pharmaceutical price gouging, wasteful billing practices, and sweetheart deals for big insurance companies. She will stand up to lobbyists to put patients and providers ahead of corporate profits, making sure that federal health dollars actually reach the exam rooms, assisted living facilities, and home care visits where they are needed most. For working families and seniors who are tired of broken promises, Quincy Bareebe offers something different: a health care champion who has already been doing the work in our community and is ready to scale that commitment nationwide.</p>

                  <p>Quincy Bareebe knows that when groceries, rent, and prescription drugs go up but paychecks don’t, working families and seniors are the first to feel the squeeze. As a former Defense Department budget manager and local small-business leader, she has balanced billion-dollar federal ledgers and real-world payrolls, so she understands both sides of the affordability crisis. In Congress, she will fight to put more money back in the pockets of working and middle-class families by expanding targeted tax breaks for working parents, strengthening relief for seniors on fixed incomes, and making sure federal policy finally favors people who earn a paycheck—not corporations that game the system.</p>
                  <p>To tackle rising costs head-on, Quincy will push to lower everyday expenses families cannot avoid: capping prescription drug and insulin prices, defending and strengthening the Affordable Care Act so premiums and copays stay affordable, and cracking down on price gouging that drives up energy and utility bills. She will support smart housing and transportation investments that stabilize rents and cut commute times, so families spend less on gas and have more time and money for their kids and aging parents. For seniors, Quincy will champion intelligence measures that protect retirement security, preserve Medicare and Social Security, and create targeted relief programs so older adults are never forced to choose between paying for heat, food, or life-saving medications.</p>

                <div className="content-body-text text-black leading-relaxed border-b-4 border-brand-yellow pb-8 md:pb-12 space-y-6">
                  <p>Quincy Bareebe will go to Congress determined to fully fund public education—from universal pre-K through debt-free community college—so every child in Maryland has a fair shot at a good-paying career. She supports doubling Title I funding for high-poverty schools, boosting teacher residency stipends, and investing in STEM so classrooms are linked to local opportunities at places like Pax River and union apprenticeship programs. Quincy will work to pass a federal College Promise plan for tuition-free community college and expand Pell Grants to short-term credential and trade programs, giving students and mid-career workers affordable pathways into high-demand fields without being crushed by debt.</p>
                  <p>Quincy also understands that Maryland’s economy and identity are inseparable from the Chesapeake Bay and our local environment, so she will fight for bold federal action to protect them. She backs fully funding the Chesapeake Resilience Fund to restore the Bay, strengthen wetlands and living shorelines, and support farmers with performance-based conservation grants that keep fields productive and waters clean. In Congress, she will champion investments in clean energy—like offshore wind capable of powering hundreds of thousands of homes—and modern flood mapping and insurance reforms, so coastal and riverfront communities can withstand rising seas and stronger storms. For Quincy, investing in great schools and safeguarding Maryland’s environment are two sides of the same promise: building a future where every child can learn, work, and raise a family in a healthy, thriving community.</p>
